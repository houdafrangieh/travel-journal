Hard coded the content to keep track of the idea and setup

Applied the concpets I have learned about "Props" to the entries and data of the journal
### -Tasks: 
Used the props concept instead of coding every entry manually to show it on the page.
Applied the key prop concept.
I can also pass objects as props but it wasn't used in this example. Spreading the objects as a prop also wasn't applied in this contribution.

Introducing API
### -Tasks:
The idea of API was introduced with a signup functionality. There is no real API in the code, it shows it works for the test 
but no real APIs were used. 
The next destination suggestion feature is shown once the user signs in. (1st attempt)
Then i kept the signup function to make it more practical
